/**
 * TOM AI — Local Knowledge Brain
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A client-side fallback "brain" so TOM AI can answer general chess
 * questions, rules, openings, tactics, study tips, greetings and
 * small-talk even when the server-side Gemini key is not configured.
 *
 * Priority order used by the chat handlers:
 *   1. Server /api/ai  (Gemini, if configured — best, full context)
 *   2. If the server only returns its generic "default" template OR the
 *      query is clearly general-knowledge/chess/conversational, we answer
 *      locally with window.tomLocalAnswer().
 *
 * This keeps live academy-data answers (students, finances, attendance)
 * flowing through the server, while guaranteeing chess & conversational
 * questions always get a useful, portal-appropriate reply.

Black fights for the center asymmetrically instead of mirroring with 1...e5.\n\n**Why it's great:**\n• Creates imbalanced, double-edged positions\n• Excellent winning chances for Black\n\n**Main variations:** Najdorf, Dragon, Scheveningen, Sveshnikov, Classical.\n\n💡 Best for players who enjoy sharp, tactical games.`

Main lines: Advance, Tarrasch, Winawer, Classical.`
